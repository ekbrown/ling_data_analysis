Kinda like a list in Python or an array in Julia.\n\nNote: values of different data types are coerced to the more complex data type, for example, if a numeric (aka. float) and an integer are put into the same vector, both values will have a numeric (aka. float) data type.\nA vector (and list, see below) can be created with the c() function (doc here).\n\ndata.frame: A tabular data structure with columns and rows, much like a table in a spreadsheet like Excel or Google Sheets. See doc here.\ntibble: A slightly modified, and better, data.frame in the tibble (doc here) package within the tidyverse metapackage or ecosystem (doc here). See doc here.\nmatrix: Another tabular data structure. Less common than data.frame and tibble. See doc here.\nlist: A flexible data structure that can hold whatever, including other data structures. See doc here and tutorial here.\n\nActivity\n\nStudents create a few vectors of the same length (i.e., the same number of elements).\nStudents create a single data frame with the several vectors created above. The doc here may be helpful.\nStudents create several data frames and put them in a list.\nStudent iterate over the list with a for loop and print each data frame to the console.\nStudents iterate over the list and then iterate over the row of each data frame, and print each row."

This is very much like continue in Python and Julia.\nThe break keyword stops the loop completely, regardless of which iteration it was in, and no further iteration are executed.\n\n\nActivity\n\nStudents create a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10, skipping even numbers and printing out odd numbers.\n\nHint: The modulus operator %% will be helpful (see here)."

Boolean value) indicating whether the word begins with one of the five orthographic vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, u).\n\nHint: The %in% keyword will be helpful here.\n\nNow for a little fun and to put these basic programming skills together: Students define a function (likely with smaller helper functions) that translates a sentence from English into Pig Latin. A little refresher on Pig Latin: If a word begins with a vowel, the word yay is added to the end of it; if a word begins with a consonant or consonant cluster (e.g., ch, gr), that consonant or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word followed by ay.\n\nHint: the stringr package (part of the tidyverse) will be useful here, especially the str_c(), str_sub(), str_split() (and unlist()) functions, as will the letters and LETTERS built-in constants.\nHint: For (many) more hints, see the script written by Dr. Brown in the LMS."
