## Objective

Students will learn about `Quarto`.

## Let's get rollin'!

What should I write? Here's an example of some code:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| code-fold: true
print("hola mundo")
```

I just said "hello" in Spanish, with the code `print("hola mundo")`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print(2+3)
```

## Visualization

Below is a visualization of a random set of floats:

```{r}
plot(runif(100))
```
